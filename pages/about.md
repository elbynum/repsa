title: What is REPSA?

**La Reserva Ecológica del Pedregal de San Ángel (REPSA) was established in 1983 and
encompasses remnants of an ecosystem produced by a volcanic eruption 1600 years ago (Zambrano et al. 2016).**[^1] When Xitle exploded, lava spread over 80 square kilometers, covering the precolonial city of Cuicuilco in its path, and creating the stony, porous ground of the Pedregal. The hollows and caves that exist in the reserve are the result of this volcanic reworking of the terrain, and today the Pedregal is characterized by shrubland vegetation. Gradually, with the expansion of Mexico City and the construction of UNAM’s campus, the original reach of the Pedregal has been fragmented: today, the reserve encompasses a total of 237 hectares. As I learned during field work in 2018, the impetus to create the reserve came in part from student-led actions (Barrios 2014),[^2] but the pedregal's existence remains challenged by unauthorized or “illicit” uses of the space, university expansion, and processes of urban development.

**My research will eventually study REPSA by engaging with the role of sound in and around the reserve.**  In 2012, Mexico City’s Secretary of the Environment sponsored a city-wide “Map of Noise,” which suggested that sounds above certain decibel levels are harmful, with potential negative impacts on people and wildlife. According to the map, REPSA sits within one of the noisiest zones of the city, and scientists are concerned about the potential effects of noise on reserve wildlife. The reserve itself is divided in half by the presence of the busy Avenida Insurgentes where cars, buses, trucks, and the metrobus continually roar past. Still, *there are areas inside of REPSA's protected spaces where you cannot hear either nearby traffic or other sounds from the surrounding city.* From a sound studies perspective, the presence/absence of sound likely shapes how people experience REPSA's spaces within the larger urban environment. I plan to ethnographically study how reserve scientists manage a threat over which they have limited control, but which resonates constantly and may shape how university students and nearby communities experience the "natural" space of the reserve within Mexico City's urban setting.
